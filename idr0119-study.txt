Study Description	Identifying effective therapeutic treatment strategies is a major challenge to improving outcomes for patients with breast cancer. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how clinically relevant anti-cancer agents modulate cell cycle progression, we genetically-engineered breast cancer cell lines express a fluorescently-labelled cell cycle reporter. We then used these cell lines to track drug-induced changes in cell number and cell cycle phase, which revealed drug-specific cell cycle effects that vary across time. We developed a linear chain trick (LCT) computational model, where the cell cycle is partitioned into subphases that can faithfully capture drug-induced dynamic responses. The model correctly infers drug effects and also localizes them to specific cell cycle phases. We used our LCT model to predict the effect of unseen drug combinations and experimentally confirmed the effectiveness of predicted combination treatment strategies. Our integrated experimental and modeling approach opens avenues to assess drug responses, predict effective drug combinations, and identify optimal drug sequencing strategies.

Protocol Description	

Creation of Stable Cell Lines
AU565 (ATCC CRL 2351) and MDAMB157 (ATCC HTB 24) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, HCC1143 (ATCC CRL 2321) cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, and 21MT1 (generous gift from Kornelia Polyak) cells were grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml rhEGF, 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, and 10 µg/ml insulin. The coding fragment for clover-HDHB was cloned in frame into a transposase expression plasmid modified to also express a nuclear localized mCherry and stable cell lines were created as previously described (Gross, Cell Systems 2019). In brief, the clover-HDHB-NLSmCherry expression plasmid was co-transfected 24-48 hours with the pSB100X transposase plasmid (Addgene 34879) at a ratio of 4:1 using Lipofectamine 3000 (AU565, HCC1143, 21MT1) or LTX (MDAMB157) and selected for 3-7 days with 0. 5-2 µg/ml puromycin. To ensure uniform fluorescence across the transfected population, HCC1143 and 21MT1 cells were sorted at OHSU’s Flow Cytometry Core and cells with a medium intensity clover-HDHB signal and a high intensity NLS-mCherry signal were selected for drug dose response experiments. In all cases, cells were validated by STR profiling (LabCorp) and tested negative for mycoplasma. Stable cell lines were then subjected to drug treatment using protocols described below.

Drug dose response protocol
AU565 cells were plated at a density of 25,000 cells per well into 24-well Falcon plates (Corning #353047). 24H after plating the media was exchanged with Fluorobrite media supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were then treated with dose-escalation: lapatinib (Selleckchem #S1028), gemcitabine (#S1149), paclitaxel (#S1150), doxorubicin (#S1208), palbociclib (#S1116), BEZ235 (#S1009), and trametinib (#S2673). After drug addition, plates were imaged every 30 minutes for 96H using phase, GFP, and RFP imaging channels with an IncuCyte S3. For single drug treatments of AU565 cells only, at 48H the media was replaced in all wells including the control wells, and fresh media and drug were added. Four equally-spaced image locations per well and three biological replicates were collected. 

MDAMB157, HCC1143, and 21MT1 cell lines were transferred to and maintained in a base of either Fluorobrite media and 1x GlutaMAX or mixed Fluorobrite/F12 media and 0.5x GlutaMAX along with their corresponding supplements for no less than one week before performing the drug dose response protocol.  MDAMB157 and HCC1143 cells were plated at a density of 25,000 cells per well, while the larger 21MT1 cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well into 24-well Falcon plates (Corning #353047). 24H after plating the media was exchanged with fresh Fluorobrite media as indicated per cell line. Cells were then treated with dose-escalation: BEZ235, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, palbociclib, and trametinib. After drug addition, plates were imaged every 2 hours for 96H using phase, GFP, and RFP imaging channels with the IncuCyte S3. Four equally-spaced image locations per well and three biological replicates were collected.
